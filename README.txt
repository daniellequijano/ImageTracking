This is a homework assignment for CSCI 442 Computer Vision written by Alex 
Irish. It captures live video from a webcam, and displays this video in two
windows. One shows the video in RGB and the other shows it in HSV.

If you click on the HSV video, it will print the RGB value of the pixel that
was clicked. There are sliders for each HSV value to be tracked. These can
be used to track a particular object.
